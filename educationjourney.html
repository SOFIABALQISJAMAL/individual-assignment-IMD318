        I studied at SMK Bukit Gading, and my high school years were filled with fun memories and meaningful friendships. 
        During Form 4 and Form 5, I took Accounting and Economics as my elective subjects, which were challenging at first but slowly became subjects I truly enjoyed.
         With the support of my teachers and friends, I managed to score an A- for both subjects in my SPM. Achieving 7As in my SPM was one of the proudest moments of my high school journey, and it is a time I will always look back on fondly.

    <i>Moments from my diploma life at UiTM Kampus Rembau</i>
</p>

<p align="center">
    My <b>diploma life</b> has been one of the most meaningful chapters of my journey.
    Studying at <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi MARA">UiTM</abbr> Kampus Rembau
    has taught me not only about academics, but also about
    <em>friendship, independence, and self-growth</em>.
    Throughout my diploma years, I have met
    <strong>amazing friends</strong> who supported me through stressful weeks,
    late-night assignments and exam seasons .
    <br>
    We studied together, explored Rembau,
    and created memories that I will always cherish .
    There were moments when things felt overwhelming,
    but these challenges helped me become
    <b>stronger, more confident, and more determined</b>.
    <br>
    Every experience either good or bad has shaped who I am today.
