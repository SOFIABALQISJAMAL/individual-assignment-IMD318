    <p>
         I’ve always wanted to go out and travel with my friends and family, exploring many places with the people I love. In my opinion, visiting another country is one of the best ways to clear your mind and begin something new. 
       Traveling allows me to step away from daily routines and see the world from a different perspective.
    I hope that one day, I will be able to do all the things I’ve been dreaming of. InshaAllah..

        One of the biggest things on my wishlist is to travel to <em>New Zealand</em>.
         I’ve always admired the beauty of the country, from its breathtaking landscapes to its untouched nature. 
        The peace that New Zealand seems to offer is something I truly long for.
        I imagine it as a place where I could <em>escape the noise of everyday life and clear my mind</em>.

        The journey would be filled with
        exciting adventures and opportunities for
        <b>self-reflection </b>.
