         I love city lights, 
         especially during quiet 
         night drives when my favourite music 
         is playing and everything feels a little calmer.
          Photography is something I genuinely enjoy. 
          it lets me slow down and notice the small, beautiful moments around me.
           I’m most drawn to the outdoors capturing the worlds just as they are simple and real.

          Nature walks just calm me down. Being around greenery and breathing in fresh air helps clear my head without me even trying. I like taking my time not thinking too much just walking and enjoying what’s around me.
Hiking feels like a small adventure for me. It gets tiring, my legs start to hurt but it’s always worth it in the end. One of my favourite experiences was hiking at Tasik Cermin, Shah Alam with my friends.
 We joked around, took random breaks and kept pushing
 each other to keep going. By the time we reached the view, I felt exhausted but happy just one of those moments that feels really good to remember.

          Watching movies allows me to explore different <i>worlds, emotions, and cultures</i>. 
          Films inspire me creatively in storytelling and visual composition, which also helps improve my photography skills.
